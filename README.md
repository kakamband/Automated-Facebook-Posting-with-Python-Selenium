# Automated Facebook Posting with Python & Selenium

Three days week I post a YouTube link to a Facebook page for a client and I wanted to see how I could automate this process.

The code in this file can be run using the program called PyCharm and the Selenium framework.

NOTE: Make sure you replace the variables in the file <b>YouTube_to_FaceBook.py</b> so that it complies and runs ok. Refer to my blog post on my website here: rajko.com.au/
